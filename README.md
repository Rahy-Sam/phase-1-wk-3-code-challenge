# FLATDANGO MOVIE TICKETS WEBSITE
# INTRODUCTION
* This project was to create a website that sells movie tickets 

# Steps used used to achieve this from the javascript file
* First I used a function to upDATE movie details on the page 
* Then I enabled or disabled the buy ticket button depending on if the tickets were available for a particular movie or not
* I then fetched and displayed details from the first movie when the page loads
* Fetch the list of movies and create menu items
* Added an Event listener for clicking on a movie in the menu
* Added an event listener for buying a ticket
* I then sent a requestto the server to update the available tickets count
